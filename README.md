# Installation

If you want to make the bot work, you'll need some things.

- For Linux users
``` bash
sudo apt install python3.10 openjdk-13-jre
```

- For Windows users
    - [Download Python 3.10.9 (Latest version of Python 3.10)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-amd64.exe)
    - [Download JDK 13](https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk13/5b8a42f3905b406298b72d750b6919f6/33/GPL/openjdk-13_windows-x64_bin.zip)
        - Unzip the file, put the folder into **C:** and rename it **java**
        - Add a new environment variable with **C:\java\bin**

Now, not all things are installed but these ones are for both OS. Open a **CMD/Terminal** and copy/paste these commands below. This command will automatically install the required dependencies for this project.
```bash
python -m pip install requirements.txt
```

One last thing needs to be installed, the Lavalink Server:
- Create a folder named LavalinkServer on your Discord Bot base folder
- [Download the Lavalink.jar](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/download/3.4/Lavalink.jar) file and put it into the folder created before
- Create a file named **application.yml** in the folder and paste the content from the example file ([available on GitHub](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/blob/3.4/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example))

# Prerequisites

Before starting the Bot, you'll need to modify/create some files, create a Bot on Discord Developer Portal and make a basic discord server to make it work and to use it.

First, let's start with the files needed to be modified:
- In the root folder of the discord bot, create a file named **.env** with the informations below (remember to replace where it says **COMPLETE_IT** with the real informations)
``` Env
SQL_HOSTNAME = "localhost"
SQL_PORT = "3306"
SQL_USERNAME = "COMPLETE_IT"
SQL_USER_PASSWORD = "COMPLETE_IT"
SQL_DB_NAME = "GestBot"
BOT_TOKEN = "COMPLETE_IT"
LAVALINK_IP = "127.0.0.1"
LAVALINK_PORT = 2333
LAVALINK_PASSWORD = "COMPLETE_IT"
```
- In the root folder of your Lavalink server, modify the application.yml file:
``` yml
...
address: 127.0.0.1
...
password: "LAVALINK_PASSWORD_DEFINED_BEFORE_IN_.ENV"
sources:
    youtube: true
    bandcamp: false
    soundcloud: false
    twitch: false
    vimeo: false
...
```

After this, let's create a basic Discord Server:
- Open Discord App or use [Discord Web](https://discord.com/app)
- Click on the **+** icon then click on **Create My Own** and after **For me and my friends**. Now give it a name and after click on **Create**.

Let's now create the Bot on Discord Developer Portal and invite it on the Discord Server created before. For this, follow [this tutorial](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/discord.html).

# Testing

Actually, no tests are available, we are searching for a solution to test the code easily.

# Launch the bot

To launch the bot correctly, launch 2 **CMD/Terminal** in the root folder of the Bot and then, write these 2 commands, one in each **CMD/Terminal**:
``` bash
python bot.py
java -jar LavalinkServer/Lavalink.jar
```
